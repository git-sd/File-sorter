# Python Application: Portfolio Management

This is a simple Python application to manage your portfolio. It runs on your localhost and allows you to perform the following actions:

1. **Display Files & Folders:** View the list of files and folders in your Downloads directory.

2. **Sort Files:** Sort files in the Downloads directory into folders based on their file extensions.

3. **Merge Folders & Sort:** Merge all folders in the Downloads directory into one folder and sort the files inside it based on their extensions.

4. **Move Sorted Folders:** Move the sorted folders (from Step 3) back to the Downloads directory.

## Setup Instructions

1. Install the required dependencies using `pip`:

2. Copy the Python code from `main.py` into a Jupyter Notebook or Voila environment.

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Voila server to launch the application on your localhost.

4. Click on the buttons to perform the corresponding actions.
